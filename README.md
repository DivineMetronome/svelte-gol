## Game of Life

A quick implementation of Conway's game of life with Svelte
Yes, rendering the board through DOM isn't optimal, but that's the point
The generation algo isn't the greatest, but, even though Svelte's re-renders are pretty damn fast, it's still a small part of the total update time for an active board

## Usage

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
